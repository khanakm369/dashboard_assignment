React + Vite Dashboard Assignment
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working with Vite, including HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint rules.
The project demonstrates a pixel-perfect React dashboard built as part of a UI Developer assignment for Juspay, featuring:
Fully responsive layout across devices and zoom levels.
Clean and modular code structure with reusable components.
Micro-interactions and animations for an enhanced user experience.
Modern HTML5, CSS3, and ES6+ practices.
Optional UI library integration (if needed, e.g., MUI or Ant Design).
Currently, two official plugins are available for Vite:

@vitejs/plugin-react
 – uses Babel
 for Fast Refresh.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc
 – uses SWC
 for Fast Refresh.

Expanding the ESLint Configuration
If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the TS template
 for information on integrating TypeScript and typescript-eslint
 into your project.
